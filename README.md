## Data Structure
The dataset comprises comprehensive banking information, organized into the following key categories:

| Category | Key Metrics | Description |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client Info** | `Client ID`, `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Nationality` | Basic demographic and identification details for each client. |
| **Accounts** | `Checking Accounts`, `Saving Accounts`, `Foreign Currency Accounts` | Information on various types of accounts held by clients. |
| **Financials** | `Bank Deposits`, `Credit Card Balance`, `Bank Loans`, `Superannuation Savings` | Key financial figures representing client assets and liabilities. |
| **Relationship** | `Loyalty Classification`, `Banking Contact`, `Joined Date` | Metrics defining the client's relationship with the bank and duration of association. |
| **Risk Analysis** | `Risk Weighting`, `Properties Owned`, `Business Lending` | Data points used to assess and categorize client risk profiles. |

## Implementation Workflow

The project follows a streamlined ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and analysis workflow:

A[Raw Data Extraction] --> B[Python Data Cleaning & Transformation]
B --> C[MySQL Database Loading]
C --> D[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)]
D --> E[Power BI Dashboard Development]
E --> F[Actionable Business Insights Generation]


## Dashboard Features Overview

The interactive Power BI dashboard provides a detailed view of several banking aspects:

  * **Client Demographics**: Visualizations of age distribution, gender breakdown, and geographic analysis to understand the client base.
  * **Financial Health Metrics**:
    ```dax
    // Sample DAX measure for calculating total engagement accounts
    Total Engagement =
    SUM('Clients'[Checking Accounts]) +
    SUM('Clients'[Saving Accounts]) +
    SUM('Clients'[Foreign Currency Account])
    ```
    This measure aggregates various account types to indicate overall client engagement.
  * **Revenue Analysis**: Performance insights based on fee structures across different client segments.
  * **Risk Assessment**: Detailed weighted risk scoring to assess financial exposure across client portfolios.
  * **Relationship Insights**: Trends and analysis based on client loyalty classifications and engagement patterns.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

  * Python 3.9+
  * MySQL 8.0+
  * Power BI Desktop

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/banking-analysis-dashboard.git](https://github.com/yourusername/banking-analysis-dashboard.git)
    cd banking-analysis-dashboard
    ```
2.  **Set up the Python environment**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Prepare the MySQL Database**:
      * Create a new database in MySQL.
      * Import the database schema and data into your MySQL database from the provided CSV file (instructions on how to do this or a script can be added here if available).
4.  **Run the ETL pipeline**:
    This script will clean the data and load it into your MySQL database.
    ```bash
    python BankEDA_(Version_1).py
    ```
5.  **Open the Dashboard**:
    Open the `dashboard.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop. The dashboard will automatically connect to your local MySQL database.
