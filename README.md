## Dashboard Features Overview

The interactive Power BI dashboard provides a detailed view of several banking aspects:

### Client Demographics

* Age distribution, gender breakdown, and geographic analysis to understand the client base.

### Financial Health Metrics

```dax
// Sample DAX measure for calculating total engagement accounts
Total Engagement =
    SUM('Clients'[Checking Accounts]) +
    SUM('Clients'[Saving Accounts]) +
    SUM('Clients'[Foreign Currency Account])
```

This measure aggregates various account types to indicate overall client engagement.

### Revenue Analysis

* Performance insights based on fee structures across different client segments.

### Risk Assessment

* Weighted risk scoring to assess financial exposure across client portfolios.

### Relationship Insights

* Trends and analysis based on client loyalty classifications and engagement patterns.
